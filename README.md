## Post-Game Stats
This is my solution for a mini assignment on Cod√©dex.

### Task:
As a data analyst for the Kansas City Chiefs, and you have been given a dataset containing information about the players, their positions, and some game statistics.

Let's start analyzing!

- Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a player. Include attributes such as 'name,' 'position,' and 'jersey number.'
    
+ Print out a list of all player positions in the dataset.
  
*  Choose a player and update their game statistics in the dataset.
  
- Calculate the average statistics (e.g., yards gained, touchdowns) for all players and print the results.
